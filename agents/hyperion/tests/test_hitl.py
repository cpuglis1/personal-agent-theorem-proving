"""HITL (human-in-the-loop) plan-gate tests (Phase 3).

This suite verifies Hyperion's human-in-the-loop control flow around the *plan*
stage of a crew run: the orchestrator can pause after planning and wait for a
human to approve, reject, or revise the plan before any work/synthesis runs.

What is under test (all in ``hyperion.crews.runner``):
  - ``gate(task_id, stage, hitl)`` — the truth table deciding *whether* a given
    stage pauses for human review under a given HITL mode (``off`` / ``plan`` /
    ``full``). Only the ``plan`` stage gates in ``plan`` mode.
  - ``run_task(...)`` — a full run that either pauses at the plan gate
    (``awaiting_approval``) or runs straight through (plan → research →
    synthesize) when HITL is ``off``.
  - ``resume_task(...)`` — the continuation after a pause, exercising the three
    human decisions: ``approve`` (run work + synth, no re-plan), ``reject``
    (fail, run nothing), and ``revise`` (re-plan and re-pause, or force through
    once the revision budget ``runner._MAX_REVISIONS`` is exhausted).

Design / test-isolation notes:
  - The crew stages are mocked (``_run_stage`` / ``build_agent`` and the task
    builders) via :func:`_mock_crew` so these tests exercise the pause/resume
    control flow with NO LLM calls and no CrewAI execution.
  - ``plan.md`` is written to the workspace directly by :func:`_write_plan` to
    stand in for the (mocked) planner's output, so plan parsing /
    option-selection behave realistically.
  - ``settings.tasks_dir`` is patched to ``tmp_path`` in each async test so the
    runner reads/writes plans under a throwaway directory.
  - Async tests use the ``anyio`` marker backed by the asyncio backend (see the
    :func:`anyio_backend` fixture).

    supplied stand-in. This lets a test drive ``run_task`` / ``resume_task``
