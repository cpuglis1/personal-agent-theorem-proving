"""Context-layer tests (Phase 4): blackboard + prioritize budget.

Purpose
-------
Unit tests for Hyperion's shared-context ("blackboard") layer and for the
token-budget trimming logic used when assembling context for an LLM call.

Scope / what is covered
------------------------
1. ``hyperion.memory.context_store`` — a per-task key/value blackboard that lets
   multiple agent stages in a workflow share facts. Tests cover put/get
   round-trips, whole-blackboard reads, missing-key/missing-task behavior, and
   the CrewAI tool wrappers (``ContextPutTool`` / ``ContextGetTool``) that expose
   the store to agents.
2. ``hyperion.tools.reranker.prioritize`` — selects the highest-value candidate
   snippets that fit within a token budget. Tests cover normal trimming, the
   "always keep at least one" guarantee, and the empty-input case.

Key design / test-environment notes
------------------------------------
- ``context_store`` persists each task's blackboard under ``settings.tasks_dir``.
  Every test that touches it patches ``settings.tasks_dir`` to a pytest
  ``tmp_path`` so the tests are hermetic and never write to the real tasks dir.
- The reranker model (Infinity) is offline during tests. ``prioritize`` falls
  back to the original candidate order with uniform score 0.0, so these tests
  patch ``reranker.rerank`` to return that deterministic fallback rather than
  hitting the network.
- ``settings`` is imported lazily inside each test (after ``tasks_dir`` is
  patched) to keep the patch scoped to the test body.
