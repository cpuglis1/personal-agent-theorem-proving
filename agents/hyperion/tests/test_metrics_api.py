"""Phase 8 endpoint tests: /thresholds, /tasks (paginated), /metrics.

Async integration tests for Hyperion's observability/operations HTTP API
(``hyperion.server.api``). Each test drives the FastAPI ``app`` in-process via
httpx's ``ASGITransport`` — no network socket or running server is required.

What the suite covers:
- ``GET /thresholds``   — shape of the budget/cap config payload (global + per-agent).
- ``PUT /thresholds``   — updating a global cap mutates live ``settings`` and is
                          persisted to ``<config_dir>/thresholds.json``; non-positive
                          caps are rejected with HTTP 422.
- ``GET /tasks``        — limit/offset pagination over the SQLite ``tasks`` table,
                          including the ``total`` count and per-item field shape.
- ``GET /metrics``      — aggregation of per-agent activation/error counts derived
                          from each task's ``routing`` JSON and terminal status.

Key design / setup notes:
- Tests that hit the DB use ``_seed_db`` to repoint the API at a fresh per-test
  SQLite file under pytest's ``tmp_path``, guaranteeing isolation.
- Tests that mutate config use ``monkeypatch`` to redirect ``settings.config_dir``
  into ``tmp_path`` so writes never touch the real repo config.
- The ``anyio_backend`` fixture pins anyio to asyncio; tests are marked
  ``@pytest.mark.anyio`` to run as coroutines.
