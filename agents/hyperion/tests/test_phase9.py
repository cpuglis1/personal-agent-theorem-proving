"""Phase 9 tests: agent card, callback SSRF guard, config export/import round-trip.

This suite exercises the public-facing hardening and interoperability features
added to the Hyperion FastAPI server (``hyperion.server.api``) in Phase 9:

* **SSRF guard** (``hyperion.server.webhooks.validate_callback_url``) — defends the
  task-completion callback feature against Server-Side Request Forgery. A
  user-supplied ``callback_url`` is resolved and rejected if it points at a
  public/non-loopback host or uses a non-HTTP scheme, unless the
  ``hyperion_callback_ssrf_guard`` setting is turned ``off``. These tests cover
  both the standalone validator and its enforcement at the ``POST /tasks``
  endpoint.
* **Agent card** — the ``/.well-known/agent.json`` discovery descriptor that lets
  other agents/clients introspect Hyperion's name, schema version, endpoints, and
  skills.
* **Task submission validation** — ``POST /tasks`` must reject unknown request
  schema versions and unsafe callback URLs with HTTP 422.
* **Config export/import round-trip** — ``GET /config/export`` produces a zip of
  the agent registry; ``POST /config/import`` ingests it back, allowing config to
  survive a wipe.

Testing notes / non-obvious context:

* Tests that hit the live DNS resolver use ``monkeypatch`` to stub
  ``webhooks.socket.getaddrinfo``, so the SSRF outcome is deterministic and does
  not depend on the test host's network or DNS.
* Async tests are marked ``@pytest.mark.anyio`` and driven over an in-process
  ASGI transport (no real socket), with the backend pinned to asyncio via the
  ``anyio_backend`` fixture.
* Several tests reach into module-level state (``settings.tasks_dir``,
  ``settings.config_dir``) to redirect the SQLite DB and config directory into a
  per-test ``tmp_path``, keeping tests isolated and side-effect free.
