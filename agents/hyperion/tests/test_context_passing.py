"""Phase 1 — direct node-to-node context passing along DAG edges.

The runner threads each node's output text into its downstream nodes' task
descriptions (and seeds root nodes with the raw idea/request), instead of relying
solely on agents reading/writing workspace files. CrewAI is untouched; this is a
pure runner concern. See ``plan-phase1-context-passing.md``.

What is under test:
  - ``_upstream_context``: root nodes get the raw request; downstream nodes get
    each upstream's output labelled by node id; missing upstreams are skipped;
    oversized blocks are truncated with a marker.
  - ``_output_text``: normalizes CrewOutput (``.raw``), a sub-workflow child run
    dict (read its ``result_path`` file), and a bare string.
  - ``_node_task``: prepends the upstream-context header; a root ``plan`` node is
    NOT double-injected (``_plan_task`` already embeds the request).
  - End-to-end through ``_execute_workflow`` (LLM-free): the idea reaches every
    root node and each node's output flows into the next.

Test-isolation notes mirror ``test_subworkflow``: ``_run_stage`` is faked to
capture the task descriptions and return synthetic outputs, ``build_agent`` /
``load_agent`` / ``discover_context`` are mocked, ``settings.tasks_dir`` points at
``tmp_path``, and ``run_meta_tasks`` is mocked away.
