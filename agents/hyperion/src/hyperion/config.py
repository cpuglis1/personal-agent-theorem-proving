config.py — load all Hyperion settings from environment.

Reads (in priority order):
  1. Process env (already set)
  2. agents/hyperion/.env
  3. ~/ai/ai-router/.env (fallback for shared infra vars)

## Configuring models

Models are specified as LiteLLM alias names. The proxy handles provider
routing and fallback automatically based on which API keys are present in
ai-router/.env. You can use:

  - Role aliases (recommended): "smart", "worker", "cheap", "fast"
    These are multi-provider groups — the proxy picks whichever provider's
    key is available, so adding/removing keys automatically changes routing.

  - Named models: "gpt-4o", "claude-sonnet-4-6", "gemini-2.5-pro", etc.
    Pin a specific model and provider. Fails if that provider's key is absent.

Override any role by setting the env var in agents/hyperion/.env:

  MODEL_PLANNER=smart          # default — Claude Opus → Gemini Pro → GPT-4o
  MODEL_WORKER=worker          # default — Claude Sonnet → Gemini Pro → GPT-4o
  MODEL_CHEAP=cheap            # default — Claude Haiku → Gemini Flash → GPT-4o-mini

Runtime override (preferred): roles and aliases are also operator-editable at runtime via
the Hyperion UI Settings page, which writes a registry at
``{config_dir}/model_registry.json`` (see ``hyperion.models_registry``). On boot the
registry's built-in role models are re-applied onto the ``model_*`` fields below, so the
registry is the source of truth and these env vars act as the first-run seed. New aliases
defined in the UI are written through to the LiteLLM proxy so they actually route (see
``hyperion.tools.litellm_admin``).

Examples:
  MODEL_PLANNER=gemini-2.5-pro     # always use Gemini Pro for planning
  MODEL_WORKER=gpt-4o              # always use GPT-4o for research/synthesis
  MODEL_CHEAP=fast                 # use Gemini-first cheap alias

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    """Central, typed configuration for the entire Hyperion service.

    A single module-level instance (``settings``, created at the bottom of this
    file) is imported throughout the codebase as the source of truth for service
    URLs, credentials, model assignments, run caps, and feature toggles.

    Values resolve in this priority order (later layers do not override earlier
    ones unless noted):

      1. Real process environment variables (set by the shell or by Docker
         compose's ``environment:`` block) — always win.
      2. ``agents/hyperion/.env`` — loaded with ``override=True``.
      3. ``~/ai/ai-router/.env`` — loaded with ``override=False`` as a fallback
         for shared infrastructure vars (LiteLLM key, etc.).

    Pydantic ``BaseSettings`` also reads matching env vars by attribute name
    (case-insensitive), so e.g. ``MODEL_PLANNER`` populates ``model_planner``
    and ``HYPERION_API_URL`` populates ``hyperion_api_url``. Several fields below
    additionally call ``os.getenv(...)`` directly to support a distinct env-var
    name (e.g. ``HYPERION_TASKS_DIR`` -> ``tasks_dir``).

    Design notes:
      - Defaults target the local docker-compose stack (localhost ports). The
        Docker deployment overrides the URL/path fields via service-name hosts
        and ``/app/...`` paths injected by compose.
      - Model fields hold LiteLLM alias names, not provider model IDs; the proxy
        resolves provider/fallback. See the module docstring for details.
      - ``extra = "ignore"`` (in the nested ``Config``) means unknown env vars
        are silently dropped rather than raising — important because the shared
        ``.env`` files contain many vars unrelated to Hyperion.
