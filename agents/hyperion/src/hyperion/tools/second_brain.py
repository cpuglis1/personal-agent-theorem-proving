"""Second brain tool — semantic search over the ``second_brain`` Qdrant collection.

Role in the system
------------------
Exposes Charlie's personal Obsidian/Notion "second brain" (the PARA vault ingested
into Qdrant) as a CrewAI ``BaseTool`` so Hyperion agents (planner, researcher, etc.)
can pull in background knowledge, past notes, career goals, projects, and investments
while reasoning. It is one of the retrieval tools registered with the agents alongside
``web_search``, ``notion``, etc.

Pipeline
--------
1. Embed + vector-search the ``second_brain`` collection via the shared
   ``search_second_brain`` helper (over-fetches candidates).
2. Rerank candidates against the query with the Infinity reranker (``rerank``).
3. Format the top-``k`` results into a Markdown string, trimming output to a
   per-call token budget so a single call can't flood a stage's context window.

Key design decisions / non-obvious context
-------------------------------------------
- The shared ``qdrant_client.py`` (under ``agents/_shared/``) is loaded via
  ``importlib`` rather than a normal import. This deliberately sidesteps a name
  collision with the installed ``qdrant-client`` PyPI package, and tolerates two
  different filesystem layouts (local checkout vs. the Docker image build context).
- Retrieval output is capped by ``_SECOND_BRAIN_TOKEN_BUDGET`` at the source, so
  the cap is enforced regardless of which agent/stage invokes the tool.
