"""Web search tool — SearXNG JSON API client.

CrewAI tool that lets Hyperion agents (planner/researcher/etc.) fetch
current information from the open web. It queries the self-hosted SearXNG
meta-search engine (part of the ~/ai/ai-router Docker stack) via its JSON
API, then re-ranks the returned snippets with the Infinity reranker so the
most relevant hits float to the top before they are handed to the LLM.

Role in the system
------------------
This is one of the agent-facing tools registered with CrewAI (alongside
second_brain, notion, workspace, etc.). Agents invoke it by name
("web_search") with a single query string and receive a formatted Markdown
block of results.

Key design decisions / non-obvious context
------------------------------------------
- Prompt-injection defense: SearXNG returns arbitrary attacker-controllable
  web content. Every result block is prefixed with ``_UNTRUSTED_PREFIX`` so
  the consuming LLM is explicitly told to treat the payload as data, not as
  instructions. HTML is also stripped (``_strip_html``) to remove markup that
  could carry hidden directives.
- Snippets are capped at ``_MAX_SNIPPET`` bytes each to bound token usage.
- Relevance ordering comes from the reranker, not from SearXNG's native
  order; ``rerank`` returns original indices that are used to look results up.
- Failures are swallowed and returned as a human/agent-readable string rather
  than raised, so a flaky web search never crashes an agent run.
