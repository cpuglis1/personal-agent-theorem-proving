"""Workspace tools — per-task scratchpad confined to ``tasks/{task_id}/``.

Role in the system
------------------
Hyperion agents (planner/researcher/developer/critic/synthesizer) often need a
place to stash intermediate artifacts — draft files, notes, generated code —
while a task runs. This module exposes three CrewAI ``BaseTool`` subclasses that
give agents read/write/list access to a *sandboxed* directory unique to the
current task: ``settings.tasks_dir / <task_id>``.

Security model
--------------
The central concern is preventing an LLM-driven agent from escaping its task
sandbox and touching arbitrary host files. All path resolution goes through the
``_safe_path`` helper, which:
  * rejects malformed/traversal-laden ``task_id`` values, and
  * verifies (via ``Path.is_relative_to`` on resolved, symlink-expanded paths)
    that the final target stays inside the task's base directory.
A naïve ``startswith`` check is deliberately avoided because it would let a
sibling directory like ``"abc-evil"`` masquerade as being inside ``"abc"``.

Each tool instance is bound to a single ``task_id`` at construction time (a
required Pydantic field), so the sandbox boundary is fixed per agent run and is
not something the LLM can override through tool input.

Usage
-----
``workspace_tools(task_id)`` is the factory that produces the trio of tools to
hand to a crew/agent for a given task.
