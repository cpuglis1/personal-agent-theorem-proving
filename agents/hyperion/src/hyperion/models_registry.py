"""
models_registry.py — operator-editable registry of role models and model aliases.

Role in the system:
  Hyperion historically hard-coded two things: the three "role" model slots
  (``model_planner``/``model_worker``/``model_cheap`` on ``settings``) and the four
  multi-provider "aliases" (``smart``/``worker``/``cheap``/``fast``) that those roles
  point at. The aliases were mirrored in code (``agents.registry.MODEL_ALIASES`` and
  ``server.api._ALIAS_DETAILS``) and defined for real in
  ``ai-router/litellm_config.yaml``. This module turns both into first-class,
  operator-editable data so the Hyperion UI can add/rename/remove roles and define new
  aliases with custom fallback chains.

Source of truth & persistence:
  The registry is a small JSON document at ``{config_dir}/model_registry.json`` with two
  keys — ``roles`` (an ordered list of ``{name, note, model}``) and ``aliases`` (a map of
  ``name -> ordered list of concrete model ids``). It is read fresh on every access (no
  process-level cache) so a patched ``config_dir`` in tests/Docker is always respected,
  mirroring the ``_model_override_path`` pattern in ``server.api``. When the file is
  missing or malformed the built-in defaults below are returned, so a fresh install
  behaves exactly like the previous hard-coded setup.

Relationship to LiteLLM:
  An alias's ordered model list is the *intended* within-group provider order. LiteLLM
  actually routes by registering one deployment per concrete model under the alias's
  ``model_name`` (see ``tools.litellm_admin``); the role aliases shipped in
  ``litellm_config.yaml`` are the bootstrap base, and UI-defined aliases are layered on
  top via the admin API. Defining/editing an alias here does not by itself change proxy
  routing — the API layer calls the reconcile step for that.

Key design decisions:
  - ``roles`` is a list (ordered, renamable) rather than three fixed fields, but the three
    built-in role names (``planner``/``worker``/``cheap``) are still consumed by the
    hard-coded LLM factory functions in ``llms.py``; ``apply_roles_to_settings`` copies
    their chosen models back onto ``settings`` on boot so those call sites are unchanged.
  - Built-in roles and built-in aliases cannot be deleted (the factory functions and the
    proxy's YAML reference them), but their target model / chain may be edited.
