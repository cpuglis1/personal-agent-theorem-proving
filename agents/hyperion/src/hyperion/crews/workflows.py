"""
Workflow registry — free-form, per-agent DAG definitions.

A workflow is a named directed-acyclic graph of *nodes*; each node references an
agent (by id) and lists its upstream node ids. The runner topo-sorts the nodes and
executes them in dependency order, so a workflow can be any number of steps and an
agent can appear in more than one node (node id is distinct from agent id).

Workflows are JSON records under ``config/workflows/<id>.json`` (git-tracked,
volume-mounted like agents). They supersede the old fixed plan→work→synthesize
pipeline; the seeded ``research-default`` reproduces it exactly so behavior is
unchanged when no workflow is chosen.

    A node usually binds an agent to a position in the graph. Because ``id`` is

    A node with ``kind == "subworkflow"`` is the exception: it runs another whole
