"""
webhooks.py — outbound task-completion callbacks with an SSRF guard (Phase 9).

A task may carry a ``callback_url``; on terminal completion we POST the result
there exactly once. Because the URL is caller-supplied and the API can reach
internal services (LiteLLM, Qdrant, Langfuse, the Docker network), every URL is
checked against an SSRF allowlist first: the host must resolve *entirely* to
private, loopback, or link-local addresses. A host that resolves to any public
address — or fails to resolve — is rejected before any connection is attempted.

    Returns:
        None: Returns normally (no value) when the URL is considered safe, or
