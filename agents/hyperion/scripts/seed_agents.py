"""
Seed config/agents/*.json from the original factory literals (PLAN_UNIFIED.md Phase 0).

Run once to materialize the data-driven agent store byte-identically with the
hardcoded factories in src/hyperion/agents/*.py:

    uv run python scripts/seed_agents.py

Re-running overwrites the five core records. Safe to run after editing this file
to regenerate seeds; it does not touch agents you created via the API/UI.

Role in the system
------------------
Hyperion's orchestrator (FastAPI :4100, CrewAI-based) builds crews from a
*data-driven* agent registry — each agent is a JSON record under
``config/agents/<id>.json`` rather than a hardcoded Python factory. This script
is the one-time bootstrap that writes those JSON files for the five built-in
agents (planner, researcher, synthesizer, developer, critic) so a fresh
checkout has a working default crew. After seeding, agents are edited/created
at runtime via the API/UI and persisted back to the same JSON store.

Each ``AgentRecord`` below mirrors the agent definitions described in
PLAN_UNIFIED.md Phase 0 and is intended to be byte-identical to the original
hardcoded factories so behavior is unchanged by the migration to a JSON store.

Key design notes
----------------
- The records are intentionally *literal* (no abstraction) so the seed output is
  reproducible and reviewable as a verbatim copy of the original factories.
- An agent is a pure persona: it carries no ordering or activation metadata. The
  role it plays (plan / work / synthesize) and whether it fires for a given task
  are properties of the *workflow node* that references it, not the agent. (The
  developer's old "only on code tasks" rule, for example, now belongs on a node's
  ``when`` field — see ``hyperion.crews.workflows``.)
- ``model_alias`` ("smart" / "worker") is resolved to a concrete model by the
  LLM layer, which routes through the LiteLLM proxy — never a provider API
  directly. "smart" is used for planning/critique; "worker" for bulk work.
- Agents communicate across nodes through the workspace files (plan.md, notes/,
  artifacts/) and the shared task context store (context_put / context_get), so
  the ``goal`` / ``tools`` fields encode that contract.
- ``developer`` and ``critic`` are seeded ``active=False`` (group "optional");
  they exist in the store but are opt-in and do not run by default.
