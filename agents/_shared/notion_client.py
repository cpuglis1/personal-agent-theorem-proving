"""
notion_client.py — Shared Notion helper for ~/ai/agents.

Wraps the official notion-client library with convenience methods for the
common patterns used across agents (read page, append block, query DB).

Role in the system
------------------
This module is the canonical entry point for any agent in ``~/ai/agents`` that
needs to read from or write to Notion (per the ``~/ai`` conventions: "Notion
reads in scripts use ``agents/_shared/notion_client.py``"). It is consumed by,
e.g., the secondbrain Notion mirror and ingestion scripts. Centralizing access
here keeps authentication, pagination, and the Notion block/property JSON shape
in one place rather than re-implemented per script.

Key design decisions / non-obvious context
------------------------------------------
- Authentication is sourced from the ``NOTION_API_KEY`` environment variable by
  default (loaded from a gitignored ``.env``); callers may override it
  explicitly. Construction fails fast if no key is available.
- ``query_database`` transparently follows Notion's cursor pagination so callers
  always receive the full result set (Notion caps each response at 100 rows).
- Notion's REST payloads are deeply nested ("rich text" arrays, typed property
  objects). The helpers here build/parse just enough of that structure for the
  common agent use cases; they are intentionally minimal, not a full SDK wrapper.
- Page creation assumes the target database's title property is named "Name",
  which is the Notion default. Databases with a renamed title property will not
  match and the create call will fail server-side.

Usage:

    pages = n.query_database("your-db-id")
